2. On each image display a small icon (image) at the center of the image.
3. This should be done using css & html & js or jquery.
4. Use bootstrap to get started with this task.
5. Move the final code to your github account and put a link to the Heroku page where the changes can be tested.
6. Create a readme file and add good documentation on how to run the code


The Design:
It is a resopnsive design with background images and "Gallery" to give it an art museum feeling.
The  website has many fonts, photos to make it more interactive for the user.


To complete this design I have used a single HTML landing page followed by CSS and Javascript files for styling and modification.
Libraries Used:
Bootstrap
Awesome Font

HTML file:
It contains of the main body and all the link files to other styling and Javascript file
Bootstrap is linked within the HTML file to make this website responsive.
The 'onhover' functions are used within the HTML file to get an better overlay of the DOM files, it is a little bit hectic but works perfectly

CSS file:
It has custom styling besides the Bootstrap to attain the niche of the website

JavaScript file:
It mainly consists of hover function to give the logo on the image and toggle its display to none as you hover it to make the photos reactive

Last but not least

PHP file:
It is only for the deployment of the HTML file into Heroku since PHP is supported by Heroku.
